## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure you have a GitHub account and are familiar with GitHub repositories, branches, and pull requests (PRs). If you're new to Git or GitHub, consider reviewing the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) to get started.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for improving CaptureCLI, please start by checking the [issue tracker](https://github.com/joaquinsoza/CaptureCLI/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If it's a new issue, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/joaquinsoza/CaptureCLI/issues/new) with a clear title and detailed description:

## Contributing Changes

### 1. Fork the Repository

Begin by forking the CaptureCLI repository and cloning your fork to your local machine.

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. It's best to name the branch something descriptive about the changes you're making, such as `fix-issue-1` or `add-new-command`.

### 3. Make Your Changes

With your branch created, you're ready to make the changes you propose. This could involve fixing a bug, adding new features, or updating documentation.

### 4. Test Your Changes

Ensure your changes do not introduce any regressions or bugs. Adding tests for new functionality is highly encouraged.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear commit message that explains the "what" and "why" of your work (not the "how"). If your changes address an open issue, include a reference to it in your commit message.

### 6. Submit a Pull Request

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub and then [submit a pull request](https://github.com/joaquinsoza/CaptureCLI/pulls) to the main CaptureCLI repository. In your pull request description, include a summary of your changes and any other information that might help reviewers understand your contribution.

## Pull Request Review Process

After submitting a pull request, the project maintainers will review your changes. Review feedback may require you to make further changes. Once your pull request is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the project.

## Questions?

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers by opening an issue labeled "question".

Thank you for contributing to CaptureCLI. Your efforts help make this tool better for everyone!
